          Imagine a dynamic scene where a runner is sprinting along a track. The
          runner's body is slightly blurred to emphasize the speed and movement,
          with motion lines trailing behind to further illustrate the fast
          motion. The background shows a track with marked lanes and a blurred
          audience, creating a sense of rapid movement. The runner's limbs are
          extended in mid-stride, with one foot barely touching the ground,
          capturing the essence of motion and energy.
